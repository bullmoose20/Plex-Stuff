# Plex-Stuff
## Random plex related stuff

## Requirements

1. A system that can run Python3
2. Python3 installed on that system
3. Preferable to also have a system that can run powershell
4. Preferable to have a system that can also run Power Automate Desktop Flows
5. System that has ImageMagick installed

## Setup

1. clone repo
2. setup python virtualenv - [I'd suggest doing this in a virtual environment. Great instructions found here - https://metamanager.wiki/en/nightly/home/guides/local.html?highlight=virtualenv#setting-up-a-virtual-environment]
3. Activate that virtualenv
4. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt` into that virtualenv
5. cd to the directory that you want to run the script in
6. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` 
7. Edit `.env` to suit

All these PYTHON scripts use the same `.env` and requirements. The Unraid bash scripts, Windows powershell or Windows cmd scripts, will vary in nature. Read the related section down below for more details. 

### `.env` contents

```
PLEX_URL=https://plex.domain.tld                # URL for Plex; can be a domain or IP:PORT
PLEX_TOKEN=PLEX-TOKEN                           # https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/

## ~~plex-bloat-fix~~

RETIRED!!! Please go here now: https://github.com/meisnate12/Plex-Image-Cleanup
 
~~Your PLEX folders are growing out of control. You use overlays from PMM or upload lots of custom art that you no longer want to use or need to eliminate. You don't want to perform the plex dance if you can avoid it. This script will free up gigs of space....It can also perform some PLEX operations like "empty trash", "clean bundles", and "optimize db". PBF also supports the use of PASSTHROUGH alerts to discord with notifiarr.com.~~

## plexdance

So your plex is hosed... and your DB and metadata is in a real mess... time for the plexdance. https://forums.plex.tv/t/the-plex-dance/197064 Quote: "The purpose of this is to remove all cached metadata and xml data for an item that Plex usually keeps. This helps when you want to “start from scratch” for particular item" My version will do a FULL plexdance on ALL of your libraries

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. edit the bash script so that the proper paths are used. I picked a very common structure, but this will depend on your setup
3. edit/comment the docker start and stop lines as needed
4. cp the bash script to a location accessible in Unraid terminal
5. Open Unraid terminal and navigate to the folder that contains the bash script
6. `chown 755 plexdance.sh` to ensure that you can run the script
7. Run with `./plexdance.sh`
8. follow prompts closely

## process-tcards

This script will use Imagemagick to produce title cards based on a folder that contains the episode titlecards stored as jpg. The end results will be in the `results` subfolder along with the `grayscale` subfolder

### Usage
1. Install latest windows version of Imagemagick (https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows) 
2. Create a folder with the jpg files you want to process and place process-tcards.cmd in that same directory
3. Run `process-tcards.cmd`
4. Original files will not be touched and results are stored in `results` subfolder and the `grayscale` subfolder

## pumpanddump

This script will dump your plex db to a file and reimport it which usually repairs your db when you are seeing corruption and unable to download the db via the ui or the plexapi. This script is currently setup to work with the hotio plex container...... It ROCKS! https://hotio.dev/containers/plex/

### Usage
1. Copy the script into `/mnt/user/data/scripts/plex-scripts/pumpanddump` folder (or any other unraid scripts folder you use) 
2. Review the paths in the file like the `sqlplex=` variable (around line 5) and the `docker cp` line (around line 40)
3. Open a terminal session and navigate to that folder with the script and run: `chmod 755 pumpanddump.sh` to make it executable
4. Run `./pumpanddump.sh plex` where `plex` is the name of your container

## chk-video-codec

This script will go through the current directory and 10 levels down (if needed) to determine which files have been converted to HEVC/H265 and those that have not been.

### Usage
1. Copy the script into `/mnt/user/data/scripts/plex-scripts/chk-video-codec` folder (or any other unraid scripts folder you use) 
2. Review the paths in the file like the `ffprobe_path=` variable and ensure that you specify the full path to ffprobe which is part of the ffmpeg(http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) suite. Consider running the tdarr_node container in Unraid as the path I used is from that container.
3. Open a terminal session and navigate to that folder with the script and run: `chmod 755 chk-video-codec.sh` to make it executable
4. Goto the media folder that you want to scan and run `/mnt/user/data/scripts/plex-scripts/chk-video-codec/chk-video-codec.sh`
5. 3 log files will be created. Review them to see the results

## create_poster

This Powershell script will create posters/images for PMM/PLEX/EMBY/JELLYFIN/OTHER

### DESCRIPTION

In a powershell window and with ImageMagick installed, this will 
1. create a 2000x3000 colored poster based on $base_color parameter otherwise a random color for base is used and creates base_$base_color.jpg
2. it will add the gradient in the second line to create a file called gradient_$base_color.jpg
3. takes the $logo specified and sizes it 1800px (or whatever desired logo_size specified) wide leaving 100 on each side as a buffer of space
4. if a border is specified, both color and size of border will be applied
5. if text is desired it will be added to the final result with desired size, color and font
6. if white-wash is enabled, the colored logo with be made to 100% white
7. final results are a logo centered and merged to create a 2000x3000 poster with the $base_color color and gradient fade applied and saved as a jpg file (with an optional border of specified width and color and logo offset, as well as text, font, font_color, and font_size )

## advanced-plex-edits

When you use blank collections in PLEX through PMM, if the separators continue to show up in the library tab as shown below, even if you have hide_collections enabled, run this after PMM completes the run to unhide and hide the collections

### Usage
1. setup as above
2. Run with `python advanced-plex-edits.py` - sometimes (usually when you have not setup the virtualenv for python as recommended above), you need to specify the version of python in the command like `python3.9 advanced-plex-edits.py`
3. Make sure that you are NOT actively updating posters or title cards with PMM or TCM while running this script. Schedule this after the last run happens. So TCM, Plex Scheduled Tasks, PMM, THEN schedule or run advanced-plex-edits.py. Example: TCM @ 00:00, PLEX @ 02:00-05:00, and PMM @ 05:00

## pad_flows
PAD Flows
## Convert_Error_No_TMDb_ID_Found_for_IMDb_ID
- `Convert Error- No TMDb ID Found for IMDb ID` => Windows OS is in English and Edge in English
- See [PAD Flows Install](#pad_flows_install)
- Before starting. ensure that you have a tmdb account and that you logged in so that the cached credentials will work before trying this....
![](images/Convert_Error-_No_TMDb_ID_Found_for_IMDb_ID.png)
`ctrl-a` is used to ensure that the flow waits until you find/click on the actual episode in TMDB (See image)
1. 2 browsers will open to assist you to link the missing ids
   1. 1st browser stays on the found IMDB page
   2. 2nd is the one you use to navigate to find the episode on tmdb after a google search is done for you by the flow
2. Once you hit `ctrl-a`, automation fully takes over and will process the addition if it determines that one is needed. It will then close both browsers down and go to the next imdb id that was missing and reported from the selected meta.log
3. Logging is enabled and found in the same directory that you chose for the meta.log in the early steps in the flow. 
   1. `tmdbupdater.log` which is the full status of steps completed by the flow
   2. `tmdbupdater-progress.log` contains your progress. 
   3. `tmdbconvert.log` is a stripped down version of the meta.log

Error checking is enabled and does the following:
 - if you hit `ctrl-a` and you are not on tmdb, this usually means that you cannot find the episode on tmdb and hence you want to "skip" it
 - if you hit `ctrl-a` and the imdb external id field is already populated (it happens as the community updates these things), it will log and skip it
 - if you hit `ctrl-a` and you get an error upon save, then that is logged and continues. if its a success, that is logged and continues
 - if you hit `ctrl-a` and you are somehow in tmdb in another language or the episode and its show is not in tmdb in ENGLISH, then the script will try to add the english translation and continue to try again to add the id in the subsequent iteration (This has not been tested because I have not encountered this yet but I know it happens because of the other flow I have used in the past)

## Convert_Error_No_TVDb_ID_Found_for_TMDb_ID
- `Convert Error- No TVDb ID Found for TMDb ID` => Windows OS is in English and Edge in English
- See [PAD Flows Install](#pad_flows_install)
- Before starting. ensure that you have a tmdb account and that you logged in so that the cached credentials will work before trying this....

## Convert_Error_No_TVDb_ID_or_IMDb_ID_found_for_AniDB_ID
- `Convert Error- No TVDb ID or IMDb ID found for AniDB ID` => Windows OS is in English and Edge in English
- See [PAD Flows Install](#pad_flows_install)
- Before starting. ensure that you have a tmdb and anidb account and that you logged in so that the cached credentials will work before trying this....
- AniDb does TMDb and IMDb  as well as MAL links 
- TMDb tv has IMDb and TVDb external links 
- TMDb movies has IMDb external link
- The PAD flow I built launches 6 browsers to six different sites and attempts to give you a summary of what it finds… it launches AniDb, MAL, AniList, TVDb, IMDb, and TMDb. Then it tries to match up as much as possible and gives you a summary of what it finds.

- You then decide where to make your fixes based on the summary and the pages the script finds for you. You hit save on the sites that you have updated and then you hit `ctrl-s` to have it continue to attempt finding the next ID that was not matched from PMM 

- So far, this is as far as I got so it’s far from perfect, and still pretty manual, but effective.
